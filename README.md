To run the project, install python and the pygame library,
open it in VSC and run the main.py file using the python extension.

Good to know:

    We have created a very easy way to load animations using pygame. If you want
    to check it out go to one of the animations.py files.
    
    We have also made it easy to add buttons, toggles and chats to your game.
    If you want to use this go to gui.py
