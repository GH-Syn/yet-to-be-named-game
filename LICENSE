Thepigcatâ€™s anti-drama license

This license gives you permission to use the source code, fork this project and
modify it for contribution to the main project or your own use. But it prevents
you from redistributing the project unless noticeably modified. When doing so,
you must use the same license and credit the original author(s).

You are not allowed to use any art without explicit permission from the owner either.
